| Done           | Closed tickets with verified fixes.                              | Verified remediation.                                | n/a                                                 |

> **Action:** Create the board with the columns above and track each ticket listed below. Link each ticket to this report for traceability.

## Mandatory Rule Update

- Enforce repository policy: **No pull request may be merged if the Security CI workflow fails.** Integrate this gate into branch protection rules and document it in SECURITY.md.

## Ticket Backlog

The following tables enumerate every finding as an individual ticket. Each ticket is currently **Open** and must be triaged on the security board.
