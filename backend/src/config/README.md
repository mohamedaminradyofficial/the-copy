# Config Module Documentation

## Overview
The Config module is responsible for managing application configurations, especially environment-specific settings and sensitive data loaded from environment variables. It provides a centralized way to access and validate configuration parameters throughout the application.

## Files and Their Functions

### env.ts
- **Purpose**: Handles loading, validation, and exposure of environment variables
- **Key Functions**:
  - Loads environment variables from `.env` files using `dotenv`
  - Defines a schema for environment variables using Zod
  - Validates and parses environment variables
  - Provides helper functions to check environment (isProduction, isDevelopment)
- **Dependencies**:
  - `zod` for schema validation
  - `dotenv` for loading environment variables

### env.test.ts
- **Purpose**: Contains unit tests for the configuration module
- **Key Test Cases**:
  - Validates environment variable parsing
  - Tests default values for missing variables
  - Verifies environment-specific behavior
  - Checks type transformations (string to number)
  - Tests optional environment variables
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Environment variable validation
  - Default value handling
  - Environment detection
  - Type transformations
  - Optional variables

## Notes
- This module is critical for maintaining security by centralizing access to sensitive information via environment variables
- It ensures consistent application behavior across different environments by providing a unified configuration interface
- The configuration schema includes validation for required variables and provides sensible defaults for optional ones
- The module uses Zod for robust schema validation and type inference
- Test coverage includes both positive and negative test cases to ensure configuration integrity

## Relationships with Other Modules
- This module is used by the entire application to access configuration values
- It's particularly important for modules that need environment-specific behavior
- The configuration values are used in various parts of the application, including:
  - Database connection setup
  - API server configuration
  - Authentication settings
  - Rate limiting parameters
